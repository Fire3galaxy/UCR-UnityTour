UCR Unity Tour
============

UCR Unity Tour is the Virtual Reality Tour Application created for the University of California, Riverside. It is developed by Daniel H ([@Fire3galaxy](https://github.com/Fire3galaxy/)) under the guidance of Professor Jiasi Chen for an Honors Capstone Project.

Ok Marco ([@oribix](https://github.com/oribix/)), here we go.

1. Go [here](https://unity3d.com/partners/google/daydream) to download the Google Daydream technical preview version of Unity. Ensure that "Android Build Support" is enabled during installation.
2. I've added you as a collaborator, so download the github project and make sure you can build it in your editor<kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> and on your phone <kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd>.
3.  After you do all that, please start the UI feature we discussed! See you next week. Make it on a new branch (I've been developing on master branch, but I'll start doing this too).
